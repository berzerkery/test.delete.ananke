# draft: true

Note: at time of initial save, this _was_ a draft.
`draft=true`

But, now it's live
`draft=false`


So, at the time we'd have to see if it renders in the preview on dev wtih flag `-D`

But now we expect all this text to render. At least as soon as we commit it, and maybe 
then cloudflare has a cronjob that only checks occasionally.
